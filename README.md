# Advent of code

In this repo are my solutions to the Advent Of Code challenges. As I discovered these event in 2022, I will be doing the challenges retroactively starting with the years 2022 and 2021. I will be mainly using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), sometimes [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) if I get stuck with self referencing structures (trees, graphs, etc...).

Each challenge's solution can be found in `/YEAR/day_N`. Running `run.sh` will build and run the solution in the current directory.

Current status:
* [2022](./2022/) - In progress
